# paranoid-eyes-conky
For those of us that like to keep a close eye on our system, it's activities, and activities of those around us. 

## Idea
Simple break downs.  See something is wrong with the battery, you should have a battery section that gives you more details.  

If you are running out of space on a harddrive, colors should alert you to the issue.

If you have a run-away process, colors should alert you.

If you're in a network, you should know the nieghbors.

If your nieghbor logs onto your machine, you should see the connection.


## Version 0.1
Really, just started with a working copy of conky from a different project.  
Now I am just tweaking it to see if I can get 
what I want out of it. 

* It does report the nieghbors around me. 
* If someone connects to my machine, I see the connection. 
* Colors sort of working, not yet everywhere.
